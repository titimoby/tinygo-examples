# Tinygamer

Everything I can share about tinygo with the Pygamer from Adafruit.

First, follow instructions from https://tinygo.org to install tinygo.<br/>
Next, install drivers with the command:<br/>
`go get tinygo.org/x/drivers`

Go in a folder and use the command:<br/>
`tinygo flash -target=pygamer`

Note, as mentionned in the tinygo documentation:
```Press the “RESET” button on the board two times to get the PyGamer board ready to receive code.```
