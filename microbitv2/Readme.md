Examples for [Micro:bit V2](https://microbit.org/new-microbit/)

The official documentation does not mention V2 for now but you can follow an existing [issue about the needed addition](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo-site/issues/226).
In the meantime, you can check [official documentation](https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/microcontrollers/m5stack-core2/) available for V1 which is close.

To use examples, you need to use the following command:

```tinygo flash -target=microbit-v2 <path to your app>```
