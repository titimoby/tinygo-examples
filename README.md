After having installed TinyGo thanks to the [official documentation](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) you may wonder what to do next.

First, you have to toy with the Hello World of electronics, the [Blink tutorial](https://tinygo.org/docs/tutorials/blinky/). 

Then, you can have a look at the documentation of the [target](https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/microcontrollers/) you want to use.

From there, we will try to show simple examples, on several platforms.<br/>
Each folder is dedicated to one platform.

Do not hesitate to propose new examples on existing or new platform!
